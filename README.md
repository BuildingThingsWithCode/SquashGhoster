# SquashGhoster
This was a hobby project. An Android app to help with the training of squash specific movement patterns. 
This kind of training is called ghosting.
The app is functional and I use it in my training but it is not completely finished.
Some parts of the source code are not published here to prevent copying of the app by others.
